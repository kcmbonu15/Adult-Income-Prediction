#Building Predictive Modelling for Income predictions
===================

This is written in  R Scripts Language

* Hypothesis generation
* Data exploration
* Algorithm selection
* Model building  & predictions
* Improving accuracy further

In real life, defining and arriving at the right problem statements is much harder than what is sounds

We are to predict which income group resident belongs to ( having >$50k or <=$50k over a year)
predict population income group
We have the train & test data sets  we build our model with the train and test our the model with a test dataset.

Since this is a classification problems, we can start with classification algorithm like, Logistic regression, Naive bayes, decision trees, Linear discrimant analysis , Random forest etc.
My selected ML Algorithms was to use decision tree for modelling.
